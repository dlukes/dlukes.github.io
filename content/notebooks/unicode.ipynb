    "What happens in the range [128; 256) is not covered by the `ASCII` standard. In the 1990s, many encodings were standardized which used this range for their own purposes, usually representing additional accented characters used in a particular region. E.g. Czech (and Slovak, Polish...) alphabets can be represented using the ISO `latin-2` encoding, or Microsoft's `cp-1250`. Encodings which stick with the same character mappings as `ASCII` in the range [0; 128) **and represent them physically in the same way (as 1 byte)**, while potentially adding more character mappings beyond that, are called **`ASCII`-compatible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ASCII` compatibility is a good thing&trade;, because when you start reading a character stream in a computer, there's **no way to know in advance what encoding it is in** (unless it's a file you've encoded yourself). So in practice, a heuristic has been established to start reading the stream assuming it is `ASCII` by default, and switch to a different encoding if evidence becomes available that motivates it. For instance, HTML files should all start something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "  <meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>\n",
    "  ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, whenever a program wants to read a file like this, it can start off with `ASCII`, waiting to see if it reaches the `charset` (i.e. encoding) attribute, and once it does, it can switch from `ASCII` to that encoding (`UTF-8` here) and restart reading the file, now fairly sure that it's using the correct encoding. This trick works only if we can assume that whatever encoding the rest of the file is in, the first few lines can be considered as `ASCII` for all practical intents and purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the `charset` attribute, the only way to know if the encoding is right would be for you to look at the rendered text and see if it makes sense; if it did not, you'd have to resort to trial and error, manually switching the encodings and looking for the one in which the numbers behind the characters stop coming out as gibberish and are actually translated into intelligible text.

But `UTF-8` can also handle many more additional characters, as defined by the Unicode standard, by using progressively longer and longer sequences of bits."
